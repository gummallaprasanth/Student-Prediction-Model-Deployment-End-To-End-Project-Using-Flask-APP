# Project Title: End-to-End Student Prediction Model Deployment using Flask 

## Description:

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting student performance using a Flask API and Streamlit for interactive visualization. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and user interaction.

## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Includes essential steps like data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.

Model Training: Leverages a well-chosen machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to learn from the student data and predict future performance.

Flask API: Provides a RESTful API for deploying the trained model, allowing easy integration with other applications.

## Technologies Used:

Python 

Pandas (data manipulation)

NumPy (numerical computations)

scikit-learn (machine learning)

Flask (API development)

## Deployment:

This project can be deployed on various platforms like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or any other cloud hosting service that supports Python and Streamlit applications.
